DR - 01/04/2022 - Seeing 1st Videos on STUDI Course "job option 1"
      "Create your own internet site using HTML / CSS"

This has to do with www.replit.com aka 
          "vscode html/css on an internet site ?!"

then for ISO-8859-1 meta (non effective on replit)
cloned this project on the platform 
    ( Linux container on Chromebook 314 ; then Fedora 35 ; then ...)
and saw the accentuations weren't good on google-chrome launch.

> ==== vvvvvvvv Post-Scriptums NOT Very related to this MAINLY vvvvvv =====

PS : Also Created ssh keys for github.com 
        ( if renamed don't works later with git !)

PS2 : Eh, there is a markdown preview in bottom right on replit, very useful ( 4text ).

PS3 : Eh did you see your replit shell was linux !!! :P
